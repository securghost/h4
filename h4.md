I started this lesson with the visit to Tero's webpage: [PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/?fromSearch=crypto)

### Setting Up Trust

Firstly, I set up the trust. I generated key pairs for both Alice and Sille, and exchanged public keys to establish trust between them. This ensures that messages can be securely encrypted and verified.

I installed required tools - 'gpg' encryption tool. The others, 'micro' text editor and 'killall' from psmisc are just helpful extras.

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

Then I created a keypair.

$ gpg --gen-key

I gave my full name and my email address "sille@example.com.invalid". Obviously, it's not real. 

I did not protect this key with a password. I simply gave empty password (twice) and confirmed that I don't want a password for my key (twice).

I now have a keypair.

The keypair consists of public key and secret key. Secret key is secret. If someone ever sees it, I would have to go to each service where it's used and disable it. Public key is public. I can put it on a web page and upload it to key servers.

Publicity of the public key is the magic of the whole system. Now I can exchange key with someone without meeting them.

### Export My Public Key

Alice want's to send me a message. For this, she needs my public key. I'll export it. Plain 'cd' goes to our home directory.

    $ cd
    $ gpg --export --armor --output sille.pub

Parameters to export are:

    --export Export my public key
    --armor Only use ASCII characters, so that the output can be viewed and copy -asted.
    --output sille.pub Save the output into the file "sille.pub"

Let's have a look at our public key:

### Alice, Simulated

Then I created Alice. I could create another user in the operating system or use another computer. But for the practice sake, I just used a folder to simulate Alice.

    $ cd
    $ mkdir alice/
    $ chmod og-rwx alice/

I created a folder in my home directory. It was protected so that only the owner (me) can use it.

To simulate Alice, I can just work inside this folder, and replace 'gpg' with 'gpg --homedir .' This way, Alice has her own settings and own keyring, separate from the one I actually use.

**SideNote: ** The use of "--homedir ." means use current working directory to save gpg configuration files. I can always give the command 'pwd' to see the current working directory, the dot "." in the command.

Listing the fingerprints of all keys prints nothing, because Alice does not yet have any keys. Not her own, and no imported keys. So she (alias I) created her own keypair:

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h4/assets/142783540/ae17baf9-21d4-47dd-a1dc-868d56f8f741)

Real name "Alice Wonderland", email "alice@example.com.invalid", empty passphrase, (x2). And the key was generated.

Alice's key is seen in her keyring.

### Alice Imports and Verifies Sille's key

So that Alice could send a message to me, she needs my public key.

The public key is literally public. Alice could get it from a web page, key server, unencrypted email - anywhere. The only important thing is to verify that this key really belongs to me. Here, I just copied the exported public key as Alice is simulated.

### [â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec007)

The information provides insights into the historical, technical, and practical aspects of cryptography, including its fundamental concepts, algorithms, and the immense scale involved in cryptographic calculations and scenarios.

**Terminology:** For the secure communication, we have a sender who wants to send a message to a receiver without anyone else being able to read it. To achieve this, they use a process called encryption, where the message is disguised into ciphertext, making it unreadable to anyone who intercepts it. The sender uses an encryption function to turn the plaintext message into ciphertext, and the receiver uses a decryption function to turn it back into plaintext. This ensures that only the intended receiver can understand the message. The field that deals with keeping messages secure is called cryptography, and those who practice it are cryptographers. There are also cryptanalysts who specialize in breaking encrypted messages. This entire field is known as cryptology, and it involves complex mathematical concepts. The ultimate goal of encryption and decryption is to ensure that the original message is recovered intact.

**Authentication, Integrity, and Nonrepudiation:** Cryptography is a way of keeping messages secure when they're sent over the internet or stored on computers. It involves disguising messages using encryption, making them unreadable to anyone except the intended recipient who has the decryption key. Apart from confidentiality, cryptography also ensures other important aspects of communication:

   **Authentication:** This verifies the origin of a message, ensuring it's not from an imposter.
   **Integrity:** It ensures that a message hasn't been altered during transmission.
   **Nonrepudiation:** This prevents a sender from denying later that they sent a message.

These functions are crucial for secure interactions online, similar to how we verify identities and documents in face-to-face interactions.

**Algorithms and Keys:** Cryptography uses mathematical algorithms for encryption and decryption. There are 2 main types of algorithms:

  **Symmetric Algorithms:** These use the same key for both encryption and decryption and are faster but require securely sharing the key between sender and receiver.
  **Public-Key Algorithms:** Also known as asymmetric algorithms, these use different keys for encryption and decryption. The encryption key can be shared publicly, but only the receiver has the decryption key.

Modern cryptography relies on the secrecy and complexity of the keys rather than keeping the algorithms secret. This allows for standardized algorithms to be widely used and analyzed for security.

**Cryptanalysis:**  the process of breaking encrypted messages without having access to the decryption key. It involves various techniques aimed at uncovering the plaintext or the key used for encryption. Cryptanalysts assume they have complete knowledge of the encryption algorithm and implementation.

There are several types of cryptanalytic attacks:

   **Ciphertext-only attack:** The cryptanalyst has only the encrypted messages and tries to deduce the plaintext or the key.
   **Known-plaintext attack:** The cryptanalyst has access to both the ciphertext and some plaintext versions of the message, aiming to deduce the encryption key.
   **Chosen-plaintext attack:** The cryptanalyst can choose plaintext to be encrypted, giving them more power to deduce the key.
   **Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack:** A variant of chosen-plaintext attack where the cryptanalyst can modify their choice based on previous encryption results.

Additionally, there are other types of attacks such as chosen-ciphertext attack, chosen-key attack, and rubber-hose cryptanalysis, where physical coercion is used to obtain the key.

It's important to note that relying solely on keeping the encryption algorithm secret is not a reliable security measure. Instead, robust algorithms are those that have been publicly analyzed and withstood scrutiny from the cryptographic community. Peer review helps identify weaknesses in algorithms, ensuring stronger security practices.

**Security of Algorithms:** Different cryptographic algorithms offer varying levels of security, depending on how difficult they are to crack. If the effort needed to break an algorithm exceeds the value of the encrypted data, or if the time required to break it exceeds the data's need for secrecy, then it's generally considered safe. However, new breakthroughs in cryptanalysis can always pose a threat.

**Lars Knudsen** classified the severity of breaking an algorithm into 4 categories:

   **Total break:** Finding the key to decrypt the ciphertext.
   **Global deduction:** Finding an alternate algorithm to decrypt without knowing the key.
   **Instance deduction:** Finding the plaintext from intercepted ciphertext.
   **Information deduction:** Gaining partial information about the key or plaintext.

Only a one-time pad is unbreakable given infinite resources; all other cryptosystems can be broken, often through brute-force attacks. 
Cryptographic security primarily focuses on systems that are computationally infeasible to break. An algorithm is considered computationally secure if it cannot be broken with current or foreseeable resources. Attack complexity is measured by factors such as data input, processing time, and storage requirements. Generally, the attack's complexity is determined by the minimum of these factors. Despite current infeasibility, advances in computing power may render currently secure algorithms vulnerable in the future. Cryptosystems are designed to withstand advances in computing technology over time.

**Steganography:**
Steganography is the art of hiding secret messages within other messages to keep their existence hidden. Historical methods include invisible inks, tiny pin punctures on characters, and grilles covering parts of messages. Nowadays, people hide messages in digital images by subtly altering the least significant bits of the pixels. This method is virtually undetectable to the human eye but can be revealed at the receiving end.

**Substitution Ciphers and Transposition Ciphers:**
Before computers, cryptography involved replacing or rearranging characters in messages. Substitution ciphers replace each character with another, while transposition ciphers shuffle the characters' order. Modern algorithms operate on bits instead of characters but still use elements of substitution and transposition. Substitution ciphers include simple, homophonic, polygram, and polyalphabetic ciphers, like the Caesar and VigenÃ¨re ciphers. Transposition ciphers shuffle characters' positions, such as the columnar transposition cipher.

**Simple XOR:**
XOR, or exclusive-or, is a basic operation where two bits are compared. The simple XOR algorithm is like a VigenÃ¨re cipher, used in some commercial software, where plaintext is XORed with a keyword. Despite its prevalence, it's easy to break, even without computers.

**One-Time Pads:**
A one-time pad is a perfect encryption scheme where a random key is used once to encrypt a message. It offers absolute security if the key is truly random and never reused. However, generating truly random keys and ensuring perfect synchronization between sender and receiver pose practical challenges.

**Computer Algorithms:**
Common cryptographic algorithms include DES (Data Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm). DES is widely used for encryption, while RSA and DSA are popular for public-key cryptography.

**Large Numbers:**
Cryptography often deals with incredibly large numbers, illustrating the vastness of possibilities and challenges in secure communication. These numbers help understand the scale of cryptographic operations and the magnitude of potential threats.
